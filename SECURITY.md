# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a community-maintained VS Code theme. We aim to keep the latest published version secure. Older versions may not receive fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please do not open public issues for security reports.
- Instead, use GitHubâ€™s private security advisories if available, or contact the maintainer via the GitHub profile on the repository.
- Provide as much detail as possible (VS Code version, OS, reproduction steps).

We will investigate promptly and address issues as appropriate.
